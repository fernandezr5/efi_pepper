# The purpose of this file is to isolate all the things that change based on
# who is running the scripts and why, so that we don't have to keep making and
# unmaking configurational changes to the scripts themselves.
#
# This file is never read by the scripts-- it serves as a thoroughly documented
# example of what settings exist. However, the scripts will not run until you
# do create a copy named `local_config.R`
